# Copper Bot

# Usage

To build the bot from typescript to javascript, run:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will create a **dist** folder with javascript files.

You can delete these files using:

```
$ npm run clean
```

The following command will start the bot:

```
$ npm run start
```

The script will automatically reload when changes are made. This means if you make changes while the bot is running, you can run `npm run build` in a separate terminal and the running process will restart.
