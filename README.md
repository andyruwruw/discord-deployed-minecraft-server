  <i>Manage your server from the comfort of Discord.</i>
</p>

Discord Managed Minecraft Server allows you to connect your minecraft server to a Discord server. The bot will give Admins control over the Minecraft server through Discord, while also adding more features for players.

The Bot uses roles to designate who is online, has the most achievements, or has spent the most amount of hours on the server.

This is all made possible by [garretjoecox/ScriptServer](https://github.com/garrettjoecox/scriptserver), which allows a Minecraft Server to be run through Typescript.
