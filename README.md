Discord Managed Minecraft Server allows you to connect your minecraft server to a Discord server. The bot will give Admins control over the Minecraft server through Discord, while also adding more features for players.

The Bot uses roles to designate who is online, has the most achievements, or has spent the most amount of hours on the server.

Players can also set their home coordinates and shop details to the Bot and easily query their friend's.
